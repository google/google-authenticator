The Google Authenticator project includes implementations of one-time passcode
generators for several mobile platforms, as well as a pluggable authentication
module (PAM). One-time passcodes are generated using open standards developed by
the [Initiative for Open Authentication (OATH)](http://www.openauthentication.org/)
(which is unrelated to [OAuth](http://oauth.net/ OAuth)). 

These implementations support the HMAC-Based One-time Password (HOTP) algorithm
specified in [RFC 4226](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226) and the Time-based
One-time Password (TOTP) algorithm specified in [RFC 6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238).

Further documentation is available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki).
